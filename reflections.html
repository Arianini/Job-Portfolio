          <p class="fs-5">
            My experience in SAS3000 was transformative. It wasn’t just a course—it was a mirror reflecting my strengths, weaknesses, and untapped potential. Through the modules, I discovered my resilience in tackling complex problems, my passion for innovation, and my need to embrace vulnerability. I observed how curiosity fueled my learning and how collaboration enriched my insights. This journey was also a humbling reminder that growth is not linear; every challenge I encountered served as a stepping stone to deeper self-awareness.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            I realized that my analytical mindset, a key asset as a future cybersecurity engineer, can also be my limitation if I overthink. Learning to balance my technical focus with human-centric thinking has been eye-opening. It’s a reminder that cybersecurity is not just about securing systems but protecting people, their stories, and their livelihoods.

          <h2 class="fw-bold">Suri-Nilay: Influence of Past and Present on My Career Pursuit</h2>
          <p class="fs-5">
            Looking back, my journey has been shaped by a blend of aspirations, failures, and reflections. My past taught me the value of persistence and adaptability. Growing up in a digitally evolving world ignited my fascination with cybersecurity. Witnessing data breaches and the devastating impacts of cybercrime instilled in me a sense of purpose—to build a career that safeguards individuals and organizations.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            However, my values, attitudes, and assumptions are not without their biases. I’ve often equated success with perfection, which sometimes paralyzed me from taking risks. This realization helped me see that vulnerability is a strength, not a flaw. My present mindset is about progress, not perfection. I am learning to embrace discomfort because it’s where true growth happens.

          <h2 class="fw-bold">Taya-Kilos: What I Want to Change and Improve</h2>
          <p class="fs-5">
            I want to transform my self-doubt into self-belief. There are moments when I question my capabilities, and while it keeps me grounded, it can also limit me. I want to cultivate a mindset that embraces mistakes as opportunities for learning, not indicators of failure.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            Another area I want to improve is my communication skills. As a cybersecurity engineer, technical expertise is essential, but so is the ability to translate complex ideas into accessible language. This is crucial for building trust with non-technical stakeholders and driving impactful change in the organizations I will serve.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            Finally, I want to be more intentional about balancing my career ambitions with personal well-being. Burnout is a reality in any demanding field, and I aspire to sustain my passion without compromising my health or relationships.

          <h2 class="fw-bold">Ramdam-Pakiramdam: Implications for Myself and Others</h2>
          <p class="fs-5">
            The actions I take today have a ripple effect on my future career, myself, and the people around me. Every effort to learn, every mistake I embrace, and every relationship I nurture shapes the professional I am becoming. As a future cybersecurity engineer, my decisions will not only impact systems but also influence trust and safety in the digital world.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            For myself, my actions are a declaration of my commitment to lifelong learning and ethical practice. For others, they are a promise that I will approach my work with empathy, integrity, and a dedication to making technology a safer space for everyone.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            In pursuing this path, I understand that I carry the responsibility of inspiring others—be it peers, mentors, or future generations of cybersecurity professionals. I want to be a beacon of hope and a testament to the idea that change starts with intention and action.
